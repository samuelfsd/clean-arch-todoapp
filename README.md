## Clean Arch Todo App

This application is a Todo List in react for the time being, but in an unconventional way. Simplifying the clean arch a little to use it in the visual layer. I use a minimalist design to represent the application! I'll be building the back-end soon.

## How to run

Install the project with pnpm and run!

```
  // create project in your machine
  git clone
  cd my-project

  // install deps and run locally
  pnpm i my-project
  pnpm run dev
```
## lists of remaining activities

- [x] it should be possible to complete a task
- [x] the application must contain automated tests
- [ ] improve componentization (button, inputs...)
